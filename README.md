# 📅 CSS Calendar Grid Project

A static calendar UI built using only **HTML and CSS**, with a focus on learning **CSS Grid**, **Flexbox**, and layout techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a minimalist calendar layout styled with CSS Grid. It was completed in under 3 hours as a speed-learning challenge to improve my understanding of positioning and box model concepts.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a calendar layout using **only HTML and CSS**
- Practice and apply **CSS Grid** concepts

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Fully structured grid with 7 columns and 6 rows

## 🧠 What I Learned

- CSS Grid fundamentals (`repeat()`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`)
- `nth-child()` tricks to style grid-specific borders
- Flexbox for vertical and horizontal centering
- Importance of mental state and timing in learning absorption
- That sometimes a looming battery death and a full bladder can be surprisingly motivational 😄
